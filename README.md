# Sum Disks
A number game using the `react-disks` package.


## How To Play?
Rotate the disks so that every column of numbers adds up to the specified sum (default 100).

You can rotate a disk by clicking on it, and then clicking either the clockwise or counterclockwise arrows that appear.

This game was inspired by a physical version I saw at [The Strong National Museum of Play](https://www.museumofplay.org/). Some variability was added.

## Settings
The following settings are configurable in the game:

- sum of numbers

- numbers per disk

- number of disks

- whether negative numbers should be included

- on mobile touch devices, whether disks can be rotated via swipe gestures instead
